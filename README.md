# Wildlife Strikes

## Scenario

You are a data analyst working for Harlock & Lewis (H&L), a company that makes safety equipment for airlines. Currently, your focus is on providing detailed reporting for Graham Harlock, the Director of Sales (USA), but you still report to Eve Chen, a Senior Data Analyst.

Inspired by both the hazard session at AirCon and a traumatic holiday experience involving parachute surfing and a nesting iguana, Graham Harlock has decided that the problem of wildlife strikes -- events in which an aircraft connects with an animal or animals -- offer potential business opportunities. He thinks that H&L should focus R&D resources on designing animal-resistant aircraft fixtures and machinery, including ultrasonic anti-reptile devices, feather-proof engine intakes, and ungulate-resistant runway fencing.

He's already pitched this to H&L's board, and they've asked you to run the numbers and investigate how much of a priority this should be.

## Setup and installation

For this assessment, you'll use the same data warehouse as you have for this module. No special setup is required.

Contact your coaches if you have changed your schema in any way that you think may present issues for this assessment.

## Tasks

### Task 1 - Investigate and analyse

Explore the available data and investigate the following questions:

1. How significant a problem are wildlife strikes?
2. Are strikes by particular animals more likely/dangerous than others?
3. When and in what conditions are strikes most likely?
4. Which airlines/airports/states would be likely potential customers for any of this technology?

Think about what you would recommend to the board. How much should this be a priority for H&L? What products/potential clients should the company focus on?

Store all of your work/queries in a single notebook file (`wildlife-strike-analysis.ipynb`), so that your process is fully recorded and auditable by another analyst.

### Task 2 - Present

As always, the step after analysis is communication.

Create a short presentation for the board on your process, findings, and recommendations. The presentation should involve slides (with key stats and visualisations) and be **no more than 6 minutes in length**.

Your presentation should be professional, clear, and appropriate for an audience containing non-technical colleagues. Although they are not members of the board, both Graham and Eve will be present during your presentation.

The suggestions you make should be **data-driven**, meaning that they should be backed up by the data in the warehouse.

Record yourself presenting your findings.

## Submission

Your coaches will give you access to a folder where you can upload your work.

Create a new subfolder in this location named after yourself (e.g. `eve_chen`) and upload:

1. The presentation recording
2. Your analysis notebook
3. [Optionally] your presentation slides

## Marking

This assessment is primarily peer-reviewed; once all work has been submitted, each trainee will review and mark two other trainees' presentations.

You are scored on the following areas:

- Clarity
- Depth
- Accuracy
- Impact
- Polish 

All areas are equally weighted.
